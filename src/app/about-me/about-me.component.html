            I'am a front-end developer based in Kassel, Germany.
            Originally starting as a mechatronics engineer, I built web development skills in just one year, including
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Angular.
            With my strong technical foundation and keen interest in coding, I have developed impressive solutions for
            websites and web applications. From metal and electrical to software development, my versatility is my
            strength.
